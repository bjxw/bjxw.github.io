                Welcome to my Software section! It's more or less everything related to what I have done with Computer Science. 
                I majored and graduated Stanford University with a Bachelors of Science in Computer Science with a focus in Graphics in 2019.
                I primarily used C++ during my work at Stanford and eventually picked up JavaScript my junior year and have been working on web
                applications ever since. In fact, this entire site is using a MERN stack!
